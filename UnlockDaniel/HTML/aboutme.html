            <p class = "setParagraph">My name is Daniel Braimah, and I am a third year student currently studying computer science at the University of Guelph. My love for computers drove me to pursue my program in computer science. Ever since I was young I had always shown great interest for computers and technology in general.  As a little kid I would always question myself, saying, how does a computer function? How does everything fit together to create user interface,solve real life problems and so on? What was behind everything? I then realized every thing was based on programming. Programming was the key to how computers solve problems. The generation of algorithms to make the world a better place. Source code is written everyday to develop,test and being constantly improved on. It has it's unique structure and design. Therefore, this has led to the development of my personal website. In doing this I hope to become one of the best programmers out there and obtain a wonderful carrier of my choosing.</p>
